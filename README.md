# Todo

Todo is a Javascript intensive rails app that allows the user to create a to-do list and check things off of their to-do list.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For this app, you will need to have Ruby and Rails on your system:
Fire command prompt and run command:
```
$ ruby -v
```

Make sure Rails is installed
```
$ rails -v
```
If you see Ruby and Rails version then you are good to start. If not, [follow this guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-installation.htm).

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/arihellyeah/todo.git
```

Install all dependencies:

```
$ bundle install
```

Create db and migrate schema:

```
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
```

Now run the application:

```
$ rails s
```

## Running the tests

This application's tests are through [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).
To run the tests please run the following command:

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

## Deployment

If you'd like to deploy this application, I recommend doing so through Heroku.
You can learn about deploying an app to Heroku through git, [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).
